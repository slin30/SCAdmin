# SCAdmin

## Adobe Analytics Admin API functions

Version 0.0.0.9000 (in dev)

### How to install

There is almost certainly a mechanism to directly install R packages from a private gitlab repo. I have not 
had time to look into this yet, so for now, please use the manual approach:

1. Navigate to the master branch (https://git.cm-elsevier.com/zhang1/SCAdmin/tree/master)
2. Download the tar.gz (even if you are running Windows)
3. Open an R session; probably most convenient to open the session in the file download location.  
    
Modify the following code chunk:  

```{r}
# install.packages(path_to_file, repos = NULL, type="source")
#For example:
# dontrun{
# install.packages("path_to_package/SCAdmin-master-37c6596be1b7afb2d65e0ecabcca9f87aa8812e6.tar.gz", 
#                  repos = NULL, 
#                  type="source")
# }
```
